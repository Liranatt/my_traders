# README.md — my_traders

## What Is This Project?

my_traders is a systematic daily trading system built
to execute rule-based and quantitative strategies on
US equity markets via Interactive Brokers (IBKR TWS).

It is not a production-ready hedge fund system.
It is a serious engineering and research platform with
three explicit goals:

1. **Engineering:** Build production-quality infrastructure
   for algotrading (async Python, C++ compute engine,
   PostgreSQL persistence, IB broker integration)

2. **Research:** Empirically validate quantitative strategies
   on real market data, document findings, and iterate
   based on evidence — not assumptions

3. **Learning:** Develop deep understanding of the math
   behind every algorithm by implementing, testing, and
   breaking it in a real backtest environment

## Current Status (March 2026)

**The backtest engine is fully operational.**
A complete run from June 2024 to March 2026 on 10 tickers
with two live strategies produced:

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Total Return | +1.26% |
| Max Drawdown | -8.48% |
| Win Rate | 66.7% |
| Profit Factor | 1.85 |
| Sharpe | -0.41 (needs improvement) |
| Closed Trades | 81 |

Both strategies (MeanReversionMomentum + CointegrationArb)
run in isolation with per-strategy portfolio separation.
The C++ pair scanner is integrated and functional.

## Engineering Guidelines

Non-negotiable rules enforced across the entire codebase:

### 1. No Bare Exception Handling
```python
# FORBIDDEN
try:
    do_something()
except:
    pass
# REQUIRED: catch only specific exceptions with defined recovery
```
Unhandled exceptions must propagate. Silent failures in
a trading system cause undetected money loss.

### 2. Strict Control Flow
Every code path must have a defined outcome. No "probably
handles it." If an edge case is not handled, it raises
explicitly — never silently skipped.

### 3. No Magic Numbers
All thresholds (z-score entry, min_correlation, RSI levels)
must be named constants in `config.py` — not inline literals.

### 4. Signals Execute Next Session Only
Signals generated on today's close data execute at the
next day's open. This is enforced by the backtest engine
(`date < as_of_date` strict inequality) and is mandatory
for live trading correctness.

### 5. DB is the System of Record
Every signal, order, fill, and position change is written
to PostgreSQL before any action is taken. No order goes
to IB without a DB record existing first.

### 6. Strategy Isolation is Mandatory
Each strategy owns its positions exclusively. A strategy
must never read, modify, or close positions it did not open.
Enforced at both the engine level (per-strategy portfolios)
and at the strategy level (ownership check in generate_signals).

### 7. Reconciliation Before Trading
On every startup, IB positions and DB fills are compared.
Any discrepancy is resolved and logged before the first
`run_cycle()` is called.

## Design Decisions

### Why C++ for Math, Python for Orchestration?

C++ computes 124,750 correlations in ~4ms on 6 threads.
Python would take ~200ms and block the asyncio event loop
(GIL is held for CPU-bound work; IB callbacks and DB queries
would stall). C++ releases the GIL before spawning threads,
keeping asyncio free. Eigen's BLAS-backed operations reach
~90% of theoretical memory bandwidth via cache-friendly
row-major layout on the price matrix.

Python handles orchestration: async/await for I/O concurrency,
rapid strategy iteration, and access to talib, pandas,
asyncpg, and ib_async.

### Why Per-Strategy Portfolio Isolation?

Without isolation, strategies share a position namespace:
MeanReversionMomentum can accidentally close a
CointegrationArb pair leg when both hold the same symbol.
This caused catastrophic backtest bugs (one leg closed,
naked short held indefinitely). Isolation assigns each
strategy its own `Portfolio` instance with its own cash
and position dict. The engine passes `portfolio.get_positions()`
filtered per strategy to `generate_signals()`.

### Why PostgreSQL and Not SQLite?

- asyncpg provides true non-blocking DB access
- PostgreSQL handles concurrent pool connections safely
- `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` makes fill logging idempotent
- Positions are derived live from fills (no separate
  positions table that can desync)
- Future: TimescaleDB extension for OHLCV at scale

### Why Daily and Not Intraday?

Daily execution (close → next open) avoids co-location
requirements, intraday data costs, and continuous uptime.
It is the correct scope for strategies based on close-price
indicators (RSI, MACD, BB) and 60-day statistical windows.
