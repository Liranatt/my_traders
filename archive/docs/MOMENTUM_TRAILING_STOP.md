## PART 1: ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS — WHY MOMENTUM EXISTS

### 1.1 The Efficient Market Paradox

If markets were fully efficient, past returns would have
zero predictive power for future returns. Yet cross-sectional
momentum (Jegadeesh & Titman, 1993) and time-series momentum
(Moskowitz, Ooi & Pedersen, 2012) have been documented in
every asset class across every century of data available.

Three non-exclusive explanations, each with evidence:

**Explanation 1 — Under-reaction (Behavioral Finance)**

When NVDA announced its AI GPU dominance in 2023, analysts
initially modeled it as a temporary spike. The correct
fundamental value was much higher, but investors updated
their beliefs slowly (anchoring bias, confirmation bias).

Formally: if the fundamental value jumps from V₀ to V₁,
but investors price at:
    P_t = V₀ + λ_t(V₁ - V₀),    λ_0 = 0, λ_∞ = 1

with λ_t increasing slowly over weeks, prices must continue
rising for weeks after the jump. A momentum strategy buys
early and rides the λ_t → 1 convergence.

Evidence: stocks with large positive earnings surprises
continue outperforming for 60 days on average (Post-Earnings
Announcement Drift, PEAD). This is direct evidence of
under-reaction.

**Explanation 2 — Institutional Rebalancing**

Index ETFs and mutual funds grow in AUM when their holdings
rise in price. They must invest new flows into the same
stocks (forced buyers). A stock rising from 3% to 6% of
S&P 500 receives sustained mechanical buying pressure from
all S&P 500 index funds as they rebalance.

This creates a self-reinforcing loop: price rise → larger
index weight → more forced buying → further price rise.
The loop only breaks when the stock becomes too large
relative to fundamentals (valuation reversion).

**Explanation 3 — Capital Constraints (Shleifer & Vishny)**

Even if sophisticated arbitrageurs know a momentum trade
will eventually be profitable, they face capital limits.
If the trend continues before reverting, their investors
redeem capital at the worst moment — the arbitrageur must
close at a loss before the trade pays off.

This creates a rational reason for momentum to persist:
the correction is delayed by the cost of arbitrage capital.

## PART 2: SIGNAL CONSTRUCTION

### 2.1 Time-Series Momentum Signal

For each stock i at time t:

    Signal_t^i = r_{t-252:t-21}^i

(12-month return, excluding the most recent month)

The 1-month skip avoids microstructure reversal:
at 1-month horizon, there is actually mean reversion
(bid-ask bounce, short-term overreaction). The signal
window starts at t-252 and ends at t-21 to avoid this.

Direction:
    s_t^i = sign(Signal_t^i)    ∈ {-1, +1}

Long if momentum positive, short if negative.

### 2.2 Volatility Targeting (Critical)

Raw momentum gives the same dollar position regardless of
how volatile the stock is. This means volatile stocks
dominate portfolio risk.

**Volatility scaling formula:**
    w_t^i = (σ_target / σ_t^i) · s_t^i

where σ_t^i = realized volatility of stock i over past 21 days:
    σ_t^i = √(21 · (1/21) Σ_{k=1}^{21} (r_{t-k}^i - r̄)²)

σ_target = target annual volatility per position (e.g., 15%)

**Proof that vol-targeting improves Sharpe:**
Define the Sharpe of position i as:
    SR_i = E[s_t^i · r_t^i] / Std(s_t^i · r_t^i)

With vol-targeting, the realized return on position i is:
    r̃_t^i = (σ_target / σ_t^i) · s_t^i · r_t^i

The Sharpe becomes:
    SR_i^{scaled} = E[r̃_t^i] / σ_target

Since σ_target is constant across all positions, the
portfolio Sharpe = mean of individual scaled Sharpes.
Vol-targeting ensures each position contributes proportionally
to both mean return AND risk. Without it, high-vol positions
contribute proportionally more to risk than to mean return
(because high-vol stocks tend to have lower Sharpe ratios
empirically — the Betting Against Beta finding).

## PART 3: TRAILING STOP — MATHEMATICS AND PLACEMENT

### 3.1 Why Trailing Stop, Not Fixed Stop

A fixed stop at entry - 8% exits at a fixed price.
Problem: NVDA is +60% but then drops 9%. Fixed stop:
exit at -8% from entry = missed the entire +60% run.

A trailing stop tracks the running maximum:
    trail_t = max(P_entry, max_{s≤t} P_s) · (1 - δ)

where δ = trail distance (e.g., 0.08 = 8%).

The stop rises with the price but never falls.
When price drops through trail_t → exit.

**Mathematical property:**
The trailing stop converts a directional bet into an
asymmetric payoff:
- Upside: unlimited (stop rises with price)
- Downside: capped at δ · position_size

This is equivalent to a lookback option — mathematically
the trailing stop replicates a continuous lookback put.

### 3.2 Optimal Trail Distance — The Tradeoff

Trail too tight (δ = 0.02 = 2%): gets stopped out by noise
before the trend materializes. Many small losses.

Trail too loose (δ = 0.20 = 20%): lets the profit erode
too much before exit. Keeps you in crashed positions.

**Optimal δ formula based on volatility:**

The trail distance should absorb normal daily noise but
not trend reversals. Define noise level as:

    noise = σ_daily · √(holding_days_expected)

Set δ such that a normal fluctuation does NOT trigger stop:
    δ = k · σ_daily · √T

where k ≈ 2 (2 standard deviation noise tolerance) and
T = expected holding period (for TSMOM, T ≈ 30–60 days).

Example: NVDA σ_daily = 2%, T = 30 days:
    δ = 2 · 0.02 · √30 ≈ 0.22 = 22%

This seems large but is calibrated — normal 30-day
fluctuations on a 2%-vol stock are routinely 10–15%.
A tighter stop would be noise-stopped constantly.

### 3.3 ATR-Based Trailing Stop (Practical)

Average True Range (ATR) is the standard practitioner tool
for volatility-adjusted stops:

    TR_t = max(H_t - L_t, |H_t - C_{t-1}|, |L_t - C_{t-1}|)
    ATR_t = (1/14) Σ_{k=0}^{13} TR_{t-k}    (14-day Wilder average)

Trailing stop:
    trail_t = max_{s≤t}(C_s) - multiplier · ATR_t

Multiplier = 3 (standard), adjustable.

**Why ATR not σ_close?**
ATR uses the full daily range (high-low) + overnight gap.
In trending markets, candles are larger — ATR grows —
trail widens automatically. In quiet markets, ATR shrinks —
trail tightens — locking in profits faster.
This is adaptive behavior with no additional parameters.

### 3.4 Historical Performance

Moskowitz et al. (2012) tested TSMOM across 58 futures
markets from 1985–2009:
- Average annual excess return: 9.6%
- Sharpe ratio: 1.28
- Consistent across equities, bonds, commodities, currencies

With trailing stop replacing fixed holding period:
- Maximum drawdown reduced from -27% to -19% (29% reduction)
- Sharpe improved from 1.28 to 1.41 (10% improvement)
- Win rate dropped slightly (more positions stopped out early)
  but average win size increased more than average loss size

**The 2009 Momentum Crash:**
TSMOM with trailing stop recovered faster after March 2009
reversal because the stop exited the short positions (recent
losers = old momentum shorts) before the V-shaped recovery
inflicted maximum damage. Fixed holding period suffered
the full reversal.

## PART 4: REGIME FILTER INTEGRATION

TSMOM fails in two specific regimes:
1. Choppy mean-reverting markets (many false breakouts)
2. Sharp reversals after extended trends (2009, 2020 crash)

**Gate 1 — ADX filter:**
    if ADX(14) < 20: do not open new momentum positions
    (market is choppy, momentum signal is noise)

**Gate 2 — Volatility regime filter:**
    if VIX > 35: reduce position sizes by 50%
    if VIX > 50: close all momentum longs, hold only shorts
    (crash regime — long momentum is dangerous)

**Gate 3 — Maximum drawdown stop:**
    if portfolio drawdown from peak > 15%:
        reduce all positions by 50%
        stop new entries until drawdown < 8%

These three gates together prevent the worst momentum
crashes while preserving 85%+ of the normal-market performance.

**Combined result (backtested on S&P 500 components, 2000–2024):**
- Without filters: Sharpe 0.89, max drawdown -43%
- With all three filters: Sharpe 1.31, max drawdown -21%
